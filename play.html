                A book that unlocks inspiration for calligraphy creation, featuring works by renowned Taiwanese calligraphy artists. The idea of making the oracle bone script fall out of the page is to emphasize the topic of the book that traditional Chinese writing is more free and fun beyond many people’s expectations. I attempt to show the history of Chinese writing. In every single bobble, they contend one type of writing from ancient times. Those bobbles together show the diversity of Chinese writing, and respond to the topic of the book that traditional Chinese writing is more free and fun beyond many people’s expectations.
