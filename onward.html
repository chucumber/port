                The solo art exhibition “Onward & Upward” features Taiwanese ink-painter Kuang Nan Huang. Huang is known for his use of window frames which brings out layers of his spacing for landscape painting. My theme wall design transforms this two-dimensional experience into a three-dimension experience. The window frames are made of foam boards mounted on the walls, moving toward the viewers.
                <br><br>
In the book cover, I transform the experience of opening the window frames into an embodiment experience that viewers can feel when opening the book. I make a small cut out of the book cover so that when the book is closed, people see the artist’s name. But when opening it, it feels like opening a window–a hidden part of his work folded in cover will be uncovered and visible.
                <br><br>
In pursuit of reaching the younger audience, I chose to use a very bright color on the cover, highlighting Huang’s another character–the use of saturated color. This color choice made his book immediately stand out from other ink-painters’ publications, and give those who believe traditional art is old and boring a refreshing feeling toward ink-painting.
